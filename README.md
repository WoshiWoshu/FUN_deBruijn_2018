# FUN_deBruijn_2018
Second year Haskell project in which the goal is to write a program that checks if a sequence is a deBruijn sequence, check if 2 sequences are equivalent, cleans a list of sequences by removing non-de Bruijn sequences and duplicates, generates a deBruijn sequence on the “01” alphabet, generates a de Bruijn sequence on any alphabet depending on the argument provided.

PREREQUISITES : Stack needs to be installed. 

USING : 1) Make && ./deBruijn n [a] [--check|--unique|--clean].

EXEMPLE :

> ./deBruijn 3 “abc” --check.
